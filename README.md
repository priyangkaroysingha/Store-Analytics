# Store-Analytics
In this dashboard, column and line charts are used in the first visualization (top-left: Order vs Sales) to show in which month how many orders we got and how much we sold
Then a pie chart is used to analyze sales by gender
Then again, another pie chart is used to show the order status in 2022
Next, a bar chart is used to show the top 5 states' contributions to sales
Then a bar chart is used to show a relation between age and gender based on the number of orders
Lastly, a pie chart is used to show which channel is contributing to maximum sales

Overall, we get some insight that women are more likely to buy compared to men and the adult age group (30-49 yrs) is contributing the maximum in sales. So, we should target more women customers of the age group (30-49 yrs). In addition, Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh are the top 3 states in sales, and Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra channels are the maximum contributors.
